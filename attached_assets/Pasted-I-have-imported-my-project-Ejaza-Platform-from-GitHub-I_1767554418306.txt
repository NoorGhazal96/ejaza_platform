I have imported my project "Ejaza Platform" from GitHub. It is a Chalet Booking System using Native PHP.

**Current Status:**
- The frontend (HTML/CSS) is mostly ready using Material Design 3.
- The project structure includes `assets/`, `includes/`, `partials/`, `owner/`, `admin/`.
- I want to use **SQLite** as the database engine (since MySQL is not natively supported easily on Replit).

**Your Mission:**
Please act as a Senior PHP Backend Developer and complete the entire backend logic. Follow these steps strictly:

### Step 1: Database Setup (`setup_db.php`)
Create a file named `setup_db.php` to generate a `database.sqlite` file with the following tables:
1. `users`: (id, full_name, email, password, phone, role [admin/owner/user], status).
2. `chalets`: (id, owner_id, name_ar, name_en, description_ar, description_en, price, location, image_url, rating, status [active/pending]).
3. `bookings`: (id, user_id, chalet_id, check_in, check_out, total_price, status).
*Please insert one Admin user, one Owner user, and one dummy Chalet for testing.*

### Step 2: Database Connection (`includes/db_connect.php`)
Create/Update this file to connect to `database.sqlite` using PDO.

### Step 3: Implement Missing Logic
Generate the code for these specific files (overwrite if they exist but are incomplete):

1.  **`register.php`**: Handle user registration (hash password, save to DB).
2.  **`search.php`**: Handle search logic (filter by location/dates) and display results.
3.  **`checkout.php`**: Show booking summary (calculate total price based on nights) and confirm booking.
4.  **`booking-success.php`**: A simple success page after booking.
5.  **`owner/my-chalets.php`**: Allow owners to view their chalets and delete them.
6.  **`owner/add-chalet.php`**: Ensure it handles Image Upload correctly to `assets/uploads/` and saves data to DB.

**Coding Rules:**
- Use `require_once 'includes/db_connect.php';` everywhere.
- Use Prepared Statements (PDO) to prevent SQL Injection.
- Maintain the existing UI style (header, footer, CSS).

**Start by giving me the code for `setup_db.php` and `includes/db_connect.php` so I can initialize the database first.**
